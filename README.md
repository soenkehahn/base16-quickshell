# base16-quickshell

[base16](https://github.com/tinted-theming) template for [quickshell](https://quickshell.org/).

You can copy the `Colors.qml` file into e.g. `~/.config/quickshell/lib/` and
then import it with `import qs.lib`.

I'm new to both `base16` templating and `quickshell`, so feel free to put up PRs
to make things more idiomatic.
